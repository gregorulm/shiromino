; You can use a joystick name, reported by your OS, or an index. The game will
; show all joystick names in the log, and their corresponding indices, and you
; can use that info here. If you have multiple joysticks with the same name,
; the first one detected will be used; in that situation, you'd want to use an
; index if the first one detected isn't what you want. A joystick name will be
; used first, then the joystick index if the name wasn't found, if both are set
; here. There's no default settings for JOYNAME and JOYINDEX.

; X and Y axes can be set to any axis number, but must be different. Set

; should be +, and if any are omitted, the defaults shown here will be used. If
; the X and Y axes are the same, the default axis numbers will be used.
