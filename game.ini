; You can use a joystick name, reported by your OS, or an index. The game will
; show all joystick names in the log, and their corresponding indices, and you
; can use that info here. If you have multiple joysticks with the same name,
; the first one detected will be used; in that situation, you'd want to use an
; index if the first one detected isn't what you want. A joystick name will be
; used first, then the joystick index if the name wasn't found, if both are set
; here. There's no default settings for JOYNAME and JOYINDEX.

; between low CPU usage and responsiveness, it's best to set it to something
; close to your monitor's refresh rate, though you can set it high enough to
; make the game run at a reduced frame rate with more lag, and reduced CPU
; usage. For 60Hz, 16 or 17 is suggested, assuming the game's gameplay and
; graphics aren't taking much time on your system. Setting it to 0 will
; basically disable the delay between drawing frames, increasing CPU usage
; significantly (it basically takes up 100% CPU usage of one core), but has
; less lag and more consistent and accurate game frame timing.
